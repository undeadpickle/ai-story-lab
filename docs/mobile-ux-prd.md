# PRD – Mobile UX

## Purpose

Ensure thumb-centric flow; Story Lab must shine on a phone.

## Functional Requirements

- 48 px minimum tap targets.
- Swipe navigation; visible progress bar.
- On-screen keyboard never obscures Next button.
- Drag-reorder via long-press.
- Previews stream; no autoplay videos on cellular unless tapped.

## Success Metrics

Mobile completion rate within 5 % of desktop.

## Edge Cases

Rotate to landscape midway → layout remains usable.

## Pitfalls

Modals that exceed viewport height.

## Dependencies

All interactive components.
